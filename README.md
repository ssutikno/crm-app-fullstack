# Full-Stack CRM Application

This is a comprehensive, full-stack Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application built from the ground up. It features a modern, interactive frontend built with **React** and a robust backend API powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, with data persisted in a **PostgreSQL** database. The entire application is containerized with **Docker** for easy setup and deployment.

## Key Features

The application is designed with a role-based access control system, providing different features based on the logged-in user's role (e.g., Sales, Sales Manager, Product Manager, Supervisor).

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard & Analytics

  * **Dynamic Stat Cards**: A high-level overview of key metrics like New Leads, Open Opportunities, and Tasks Due Today. The data is filtered based on the user's role.
  * **Interactive Charts**: Visualizations for sales performance and lead conversion funnels.
  * **Recent Activity Feed**: A timeline of the latest events, such as new leads and won deals.
  * **Analytics Page**: A dedicated reporting page showing sales summaries, top-performing sales reps, and top-selling products.

### ðŸ’¼ Sales & Customer Management

  * **Lead Management**: A full CRUD interface for managing leads, with sorting, searching, and pagination.
  * **Lead Conversion Workflow**: A one-click action to convert a qualified lead into a new Customer and a new Deal in the sales pipeline.
  * **Visual Sales Pipeline**: An interactive drag-and-drop board to manage deals across different sales stages (New, Qualifying, Proposal, Won, Lost).
  * **Deal Details**: A comprehensive modal view for each deal, showing linked products, notes, and attachments.
  * **Customer Management**: A full CRUD interface for managing customer accounts, with a 360-degree view of contacts, notes, and associated deals.

### ðŸ“¦ Product & Quote Management

  * **Product Catalog**: A searchable and filterable catalog of all company products and services.
  * **Product Attachments**: Ability to add and manage attachments (e.g., datasheets, marketing materials) for each product.
  * **Product Requests**: A workflow for sales users to request new products from within a deal. Product managers can review, approve, and convert these requests into actual products.
  * **Quote Creation**: A seamless process to create a new quote directly from a deal, which automatically pre-populates linked products and customer information.

### ðŸ‘¤ User & Account Management

  * **Secure Authentication**: A complete login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with secure password hashing (`bcryptjs`).
  * **Role-Based Access Control**: Menus and actions are dynamically shown or hidden based on the user's role (e.g., only supervisors can access User Management).
  * **User Management Page**: A secure page for supervisors to create, edit, and delete user accounts.
  * **Password Reset**: Supervisors can reset passwords for other users.
  * **User Profile Page**: Users can update their own profile information and change their password.
  * **Settings Page**: Includes user-specific settings like a **Dark Mode** toggle, with preferences saved in the browser.

## Tech Stack

  * **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the API server.
  * **PostgreSQL** for the relational database.
